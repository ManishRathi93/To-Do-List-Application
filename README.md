### Project Description: To-Do List Application

#### **Overview**
This project is a simple and functional **To-Do List application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, marking, and removing tasks. The interface is visually appealing with a modern design, though it is not fully optimized for all screen sizes.

#### **Features**
1. **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks through an input field and a button.
2. **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Clicking on a task toggles its status between completed and incomplete, with visual indicators.
3. **Remove Tasks**: Completed tasks reveal a delete icon, enabling users to remove them.
4. **Interactive Design**: Smooth interactions are implemented using JavaScript for a better user experience.

#### **Technologies Used**
- **HTML**: Structures the content of the application.
- **CSS**: Styles the application, including task states (e.g., checked and unchecked), color gradients, and button styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity for task management, such as toggling states, appending new tasks, and deleting tasks.

#### **Design Highlights**
- Modern card layout with gradient background.
- Task indicators: unchecked and checked icons.
- Smooth toggling between task states with dynamic styles.

#### **Limitations**
- **Responsiveness**: The current design works best on medium to large screens. On smaller devices, the layout may not scale properly, leading to potential usability challenges.
- **No Data Persistence**: Tasks are not stored permanently (e.g., local storage or database integration is missing).

#### **Future Improvements**
1. **Make Responsive**: Enhance the layout using media queries to optimize for mobile devices and smaller screens.
2. **Add Persistence**: Implement local storage to save tasks even after refreshing the page.
3. **Enhanced Features**: Add categories, task priorities, and deadlines for better task management.
4. **Accessibility**: Improve keyboard navigation and add ARIA attributes for better usability.
