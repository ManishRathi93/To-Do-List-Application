# To-Do-List-Application
This project is a simple and functional To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, marking, and removing tasks. The interface is visually appealing with a modern design, though it is not fully optimized for all screen sizes.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks through an input field and a button.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Clicking on a task toggles its status between completed and incomplete, with visual indicators.
Remove Tasks: Completed tasks reveal a delete icon, enabling users to remove them.
Interactive Design: Smooth interactions are implemented using JavaScript for a better user experience.
Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the content of the application.
CSS: Styles the application, including task states (e.g., checked and unchecked), color gradients, and button styling.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity for task management, such as toggling states, appending new tasks, and deleting tasks.
Design Highlights
Modern card layout with gradient background.
Task indicators: unchecked and checked icons.
Smooth toggling between task states with dynamic styles.
Limitations
Responsiveness: The current design works best on medium to large screens. On smaller devices, the layout may not scale properly, leading to potential usability challenges.
No Data Persistence: Tasks are not stored permanently (e.g., local storage or database integration is missing).
Future Improvements
Make Responsive: Enhance the layout using media queries to optimize for mobile devices and smaller screens.
Add Persistence: Implement local storage to save tasks even after refreshing the page.
Enhanced Features: Add categories, task priorities, and deadlines for better task management.
Accessibility: Improve keyboard navigation and add ARIA attributes for better usability.
This project is a great example of how basic web development technologies can create a functional and interactive application, with room for enhancements and scalability.
