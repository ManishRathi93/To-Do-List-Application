# To-Do-List-Application
This project is a simple and functional To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, marking, and removing tasks. The interface is visually appealing with a modern design, though it is not fully optimized for all screen sizes.
